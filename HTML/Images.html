<br>Mock services are a great way of getting testing early into the picture of a service-oriented project. Once the WSDL of the web service is ready, you can simulate the service implementation and start testing the consumer applications.

<ul>
<li>Application “A” bundles Employee information into  a Soap Message and sends to -   WebService “B” over HTTP-request</li>
<li>Web Service “B” unpacks the SOAP request and converts it into a command that the Dontnet application can understand</li>
<li>Next, the Web Service B packages up the response into another SOAP message, which it sends back to the Application “A” in response to its HTTP request.-response</li>
<li>The Application “A” unpacks the SOAP message to obtain the results of the account registration process</li>
</ul>
