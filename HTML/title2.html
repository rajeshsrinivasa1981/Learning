Every or Any DB has 2 components â€“ Client and Server. Client is used to request the data to Server using SQL commands using Client Software and Server stores the information. Note: Connection need to be established between Client and Server for communication. 

<p><center><font color="green" size="4">Client and Server can be installed in one machine or different machines (Server can be installed in remote machine). DB servers will be installed on LINUX or UNIX Operating Systems. Very rarely installed on windows OS due to less security purpose. </font></center></p>

<b>WSDL definition describes how to access a web service and what operations it will perform.</b><br>
<i>WSDL is often used in combination with SOAP and XML Schema to provide web<wbr>services over the Internet</i><br>

The general format for reading the custom or default property value is ${#levelname#key}

Mock services are a great way of getting testing early into the picture of a service-oriented project. Once the WSDL of the web service is ready, you can simulate the service implementation and start testing the consumer applications
